# Search
This is an Artificial Intelligence project for my TCSS 435 class at UW Tacoma.
Also, it mirrors Project 1 of Berkeley's CS188.1x - Artificial Intelligence from EDX / UC Berkeley.
In this project I implemented four search algorithms:

Depth First Search
Breadth First Search
Uniform Cost Search
A* search
